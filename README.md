# credora3

## Overview
This project builds a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is based on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset.

## Folder Structure

- `bank-full.csv` — Main dataset.
- `decision_tree_customer_prediction.py` — Python script with the full analysis, preprocessing, model building, and visualization.
- `Project_Report.md` — Detailed data science project report.
- `Requirements_and_Overview.md` — Project requirements and summary.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Usage

1. Make sure `bank-full.csv` is in the project directory.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python decision_tree_customer_prediction.py
   ```
   This will output model evaluation and display a visualization of the decision tree.

### Documentation

- **Project_Report.md** — Complete project writeup, including methodology, results, and conclusions.
- **Requirements_and_Overview.md** — Requirements and deliverables.

### Results

- Model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are printed after running the script.
- A decision tree visualization is shown.
